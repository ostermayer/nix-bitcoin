  ### BITCOIND
  # Bitcoind is enabled by default via secure-node.nix.
  #
  # Set this option to enable pruning with a specified MiB value.
  # NOTE: LND and electrs are not compatible with pruning.
  # services.bitcoind.prune = 100000;
  #
  # Set this to accounce the onion service address to peers.
  # The onion service allows accepting incoming connections via Tor.

  #
  # You can add options that are not defined in modules/bitcoind.nix as follows
  # services.bitcoind.extraConfig = ''
  #   maxorphantx=110
  # '';

  ### LND
  # Enable lnd, a lightning implementation written in Go.
  services.lnd.enable = true;
  #
  # Set this to create an onion service by which lnd can accept incoming connections
  # via Tor.
  # The onion service is automatically announced to peers.
  # nix-bitcoin.onionServices.lnd.public = true;
  #
  # Set this to create a lnd REST onion service.
  # This also adds binary `lndconnect` to the system environment.
  # This binary generates QR codes or URLs for connecting applications to lnd via the
  # REST onion service.
  # You can also connect via WireGuard instead of Tor.
  # See ../docs/services.md for details.
  #
  # services.lnd.lndconnect = {

  # };
  #
  ## WARNING
  # If you use lnd, you should manually backup your wallet mnemonic
  # seed. This will allow you to recover on-chain funds. You can run the
  # following commands after the lnd service starts:
  #   mkdir -p ./backups/lnd/
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/lnd-seed-mnemonic ./backups/lnd/
  #
  # You should also backup your channel state after opening new channels.
  # This will allow you to recover off-chain funds, by force-closing channels.
  #   scp bitcoin-node:/var/lib/lnd/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/channel.backup ./backups/lnd/
  #
  # Alternatively, you can have these files backed up by services.backups below.

  ### ELECTRS
  # Set this to enable electrs, an Electrum server implemented in Rust.
  # services.electrs.enable = true;

  ### BTCPayServer
  # Set this to enable BTCPayServer, a self-hosted, open-source
  # cryptocurrency payment processor.
  # services.btcpayserver.enable = true;
  #
  # Privacy Warning: BTCPayServer currently looks up price rates without
  # proxying them through Tor. This means an outside observer can correlate
  # your BTCPayServer usage, like invoice creation times, with your IP address.
  #
  # Enable this option to connect BTCPayServer to lnd.
  # services.btcpayserver.lightningBackend = "lnd";
  #
  # The lightning backend service is automatically enabled.
  # Afterwards you need to go into Store > General Settings > Lightning Nodes
  # and select "the internal lightning node of this BTCPay Server".
  #
  # Set this to create an onion service to make the btcpayserver web interface
  # accessible via Tor.
  # Security WARNING: Create a btcpayserver administrator account before allowing
  # public access to the web interface.
  # nix-bitcoin.onionServices.btcpayserver.enable = true;

  ### Nodeinfo
  # Set this to add command `nodeinfo` to the system environment.
  # It shows info about running services like onion addresses and local addresses.
  # It is enabled by default when importing `secure-node.nix`.
  # nix-bitcoin.nodeinfo.enable = true;

  ### Backups
  # Set this to enable nix-bitcoin's own backup service. By default, it
  # uses duplicity to incrementally back up all important files in /var/lib to
  # /var/lib/localBackups once a day.
  # services.backups.enable = true;
  #
  # You can pull the localBackups folder with
  # `scp -r bitcoin-node:/var/lib/localBackups /my-backup-path/`
  # Alternatively, you can also set a remote target url, for example
  # services.backups.destination = "sftp://user@host[:port]/[relative|/absolute]_path";
  # Supply the sftp password by appending the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable
  # to secrets/backup-encryption-env like so
  # `echo "FTP_PASSWORD=<password>" >> secrets/backup-encryption-env`
  # You many also need to set a ssh host and publickey with
  # programs.ssh.knownHosts."host" = {
  #   hostNames = [ "host" ];
  #   publicKey = "<ssh public from `ssh-keyscan`>";
  # };
  # If you also want to backup bulk data like the Bitcoin blockchain
  # and electrs data directory, enable
  # services.backups.with-bulk-data = true;

  ### netns-isolation (EXPERIMENTAL)
  # Enable this module to use Network Namespace Isolation. This feature places
  # every service in its own network namespace and only allows truly necessary
  # connections between network namespaces, making sure services are isolated on
  # a network-level as much as possible.
